#experiment ideas
    #1. given random graphs with a constant number of nodes, 
    #   the accuracy of the total_dist as the number of k increases?

    #2. given constant k, accuracy of total_dist as graph increases in size

    #3. given constant k and graph size, accuracy of total_dist as graph density increases?

    #4. compare accuracy (based on relaxations) of dijskrta to bellman ford or whatever its called
    
    #5. see if less runtime if less relaxations??
