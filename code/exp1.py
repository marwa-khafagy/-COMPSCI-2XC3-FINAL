#experiment ideas
    #1. given random graphs with a constant number of nodes, 
    #   the accuracy of the total_dist as the number of k increases?
    #2. given constant k, accuracy of total_dist as graph increases in size
    #3. given constant k and graph size, accuracy of total_dist as graph density increases?
